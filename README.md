Hi, I'm Chaitanya! 👋
Enterprise AI Architect | I Build "Revenue-Saving" Robots

I specialize in building AI ecosystems that act as the perfect employee: they never sleep, never miss a call, and never forget to follow up. My focus is on high-reliability, multi-tenant architectures for service-based businesses.





🛠 My "Pro" Tech Stack

The Brains: Gravity AI for smart lead scoring and intent analysis.




The Glue: n8n workflow orchestration for complex business logic.



The Engine: Python 3.10+ with Flask/Gunicorn for production-grade speed.




The Infrastructure: Twilio (Voice/SMS) with a focus on full A2P 10DLC compliance.





The Vault: SQLite configured with WAL Mode for high-performance data handling.





🚀 What I've Built Lately

AI Lead Response Agent 📞

The Problem: Small businesses lose 60% of leads because they can't answer the phone while working.




The Solution: An intercept system that converts missed calls into SMS conversations in under 5 seconds.



The "Secret Sauce": Built-in Auto-Healing and Watchdog monitoring to ensure 99.9% uptime.





AI Cold Outreach Engine 📧

An autonomous prospecting powerhouse that finds, qualifies, and nurtures leads using my signature 3-Layer Architecture.



💡 Why Work With Me?

I don't just write code; I build systems designed for the real world:

Compliance-First: I handle the "boring" legal stuff like TCPA and CASL so you don't have to.





Cost Guardrails: My systems include automated monitors to prevent billing spikes or runaway processes.




Deterministic Logic: I use a Directive -> Orchestration -> Execution framework to eliminate AI "hallucinations" in your business paths.
